The Password Generator project is a JavaScript focused project requiring the use of arrays, functions, loops, and methods to generate a random password. When a user clicks the "Generate" button, multiple prompts will appear asking the user to input a length, whether to include special, numeric, and upper and lower case characters. If the users does not follow the user promps correctly, the user will be prompted again to input the correct responses to meet the criteria for the password.
